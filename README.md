# Machine-learning

ðŸ”¥ Achieved 91% accuracy in binary classification using Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM).

In this project, machine learning algorithms including KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and GBM were applied to a dataset of AIDS patients after thorough data cleaning and preprocessing.
